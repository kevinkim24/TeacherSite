Hello, Exeter Summer 2023 students from my Intro. to Computer Science class: <br><br>
Thank you. <br><br>
Thank you for helping make my first teaching experience so memorable. Throughout the summer, we learned together: as you learned to code, I learned to 
<s style="color:red;">teach</s> facilitate knowledge at the Harkness table, making the subject the center of the classroom instead of myself. 
Though I made countless mistakes along the way, your gritty, hard work, deep curiosity, admirable aptitude, and pleasant attitude gave me room to realize my mistakes and learn from them. Simultaneously, your engagement in the classroom encouraged me to keep going, no matter the amount of coffee I was drinking along the way. Prior to Exeter, I wasn't sure if teaching was right for me. However, through the tremendously rewarding experience you helped create, I have resolved to continue pursuing teaching. You inspire me every day, and will always impact my instruction. <br><br>

It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience getting to work with such a diverse group of students, from all corners of the world. I hope you can take what you learned from Exeter back to your home, and make an impact in your community, and everywhere else you go. I await to see you again someday--it's a small world. <br><br>
